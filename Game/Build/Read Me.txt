Instructions:
	When the start screen loads, enter your name and hit play.
		When the arena loads, use your gravity to manipulate the surrounding asteroids to collide with
	each other. 

	 - 	Asteroids that are close enough to you while you have gravity on will become destructible for
		three seconds after either the gravity is turned off or they move out of range.
	 - 	If an asteroid hits a destructible asteroid, or collides with any asteroid while it is destructible
		itself, both will die.
	 - 	If a large or medium asteroid dies, it will split into two asteroids of the size immediately below 
		it (small asteroids will just die).

	If you manipulate asteroids to collide and kill each other, you will progress by 1%. This is your progress
	towards being promoted from "asteroid" to "planet". Reach 100% to win and become a planet. Do it the
	fastest, and you will jump to the top of the scoreboard. 
		If you get hit by an asteroid, you will lose a life and gain a few seconds of immunity. Lose all
	of your lives, and it's GAME OVER!
		At the end of the game, feel free to try again or to quit.

Controls:
	W: Up
	A: Left
	S: Down
	D: Right

	Hold Spacebar: Gravity on
	Hold Left Mouse Button: Gravity on

Notes:
	When you open the build, in the input section, it lists	a number of other control options. No idea how to pull
	those out (it's probably been mentioned and forgotten), so just ignore them. None of them should have any function
	anyway. Jumping with the spacebar and rotating with the left/right arrow keys was definitely disabled, so don't
	bother trying to do either of those things.

Enjoy :)
